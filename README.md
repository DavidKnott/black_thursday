## Black Thursday

A business is only as smart as its data. We built a system in Ruby to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.

To run:

1.  Enter "git clone git@github.com:DavidKnott/black_thursday.git" into your terminal.
2.  Enter "cd black_thursday"
3.  Enter "rake"
4.  See 307 tests pass before your very eyes.
