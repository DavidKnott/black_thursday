# Black Thursday


A business is only as smart as its data. We built a system in Ruby to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.


## Collecting the Data
Our application runs on data collected from CSV files.


## Analysis
We started by creating a class for all the diferent types of data and then went on to find data the would help vendors such as which product sold the most in terms of revenue.

## Setup Instructions
Run these commands in this order:
```
git clone git@github.com:DavidKnott/black_thursday.git
cd black_thursday
rake

```
And see 307 tests pass before your very eyes.
